"""Closes sockets for workspaces this instance no longer owns.

The proxy hashes a workspace to one instance. When the pool changes, some
workspaces move, but sockets opened before the move stay attached to the old
instance: writes reach the new owner while the viewer waits on the old one and
its plots silently stop. An instance cannot detect this on its own, because
traffic for a lost workspace simply stops arriving and silence is not a signal.

So each instance periodically asks the proxy who owns the workspaces it is
holding sockets for, and closes the ones that have moved. The hash stays in one
place: this asks the component that owns the routing decision rather than
reimplementing it.
